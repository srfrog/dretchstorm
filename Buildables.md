# Introduction #

> Each team has a set of buildables that are required for team survival and improvements. All these buildables require materials to be built and repaired when damaged. Once built, they will consume quantum energy at a specific rate, but buildables with energy banks will store it (not consume).

# Guidelines #

  * Average recommended Polycount for buildables: 1,500-5,000
  * Texture size: 512x512 or 1024x1024
  * With diffuse, specular and normal maps
  * Export to MD5 (md5mesh and md5anim) format or MD3

| Name | HP | Armor | Cost | E<sub>power</sub> | E<sub>store</sub> | Description |
|:-----|:---|:------|:-----|:------------------|:------------------|:------------|
| Command Center (C<sup>4</sup>PB) | 4000 | 600 | 4000u | 5e/m | 600e | Contains the primary energy banks and the research computer:  Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Power Bank.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4ISTAR |
| Telepad | - | - | - | - | - | Spawns players into the game, and teleports to different locations |
| Fabricator | - | - | - | - | - | Resupply ammo and change weapons; recycles materials.  It is a versatile, miniaturized, automated refinery, forge, machine shop, and warehouse.  It does so much that this thing must be dimensionally transcendental, right? |
| Sentry Turret | - | - | - | - | - | Electromechanical machinegun turret. Fast to lock and fires rapidly; weak vs larger aliens |
| LAW Turret | - | - | - | - | - | The light anti-tank weapon turret.  It is a small rocket launcher, originally designed for anti-tank use.  Only able to acquire a lock on the larger quarry, it does a devastating amount of damage and rarely misses (guided?).  It has a small magazine capacity (6 tubes?) that must be manually reloaded (at a cost.) |
| Transducer | - | - | - | - | - | Converts mineral energy (from Elerium) to quantum energy |
| Shock barrier | - | - | - | - | - | An electrified barrier.  When aliens contact the barrier they are violently repelled due to muscular spasms.  The shock also induces a momentary neural depolarization resulting in brief paralysis (in other words, it stuns too). |

## Aliens ##

| Name | HP | Armor | Cost | E<sub>power</sub> | E<sub>store</sub> | Description|
|:-----|:---|:------|:-----|:------------------|:------------------|:-----------|
| Hypermind | - | - | - | - | - | Sentient central intelligence, consumes raw energy and focuses psionic power.  A big pile of brains surrounded by a thick layer of impact-absorbing, energy-storing blubber?  With tentacles. |
| Burrow | - | - | - | - | - | Moves players to different points on the map, that have end-point burrows |
| Brood Sack | - | - | - | - | - | Spawns players into the game and harvests energy from mineral deposits |
| Acid Tube | - | - | - | - | - | spews blobs of acid to nearby humans |
| Gel Blob | - | - | - | - | - | Sprays a sticky, tarry substance.  Gums up guns and gear, disorients? |
| Venom hive | - | - | - | - | - | shoots venomous darts to nearby humans |
| Barricade | - | - | - | - | - | Blocks access to human attackers |
