### Audio Formats ###

Weapons and effects (environmental): **16-bit WAV Mono 44.1khz**

Buildables, players: **16-bit WAV Mono 22khz**

Background music: **OGG Stereo 128-160kbps**

Main menu music:  **Ogg 192kbps-224kbps**


All sounds must be mono and 16 bit. If the sound is already 48k or you are recording at a high enough sample rate to have 48k then do not worry about down sampling it 44.1k we will test them out the game at a later time and down sample if necessary.

### Additional Info ###

Since the sounds that are being made will go on the xreal engine they will support .ogg or .wav but for the sounds, we will be using .wav (buildables, ambient, weapons, characters, etc.) For the music, the music needs to be in ogg form. Music or any background ambiance that will exceed longer then a sound will.

Why you ask? A .ogg is a compressed format so larger files will be compressed where as compressing a half a second sound will be considered worthless in my opinion. B. .ogg seems to be perfect provider for efficient streaming which is a reason we will be using it for larger files. Making it a good choice for keeping the game smooth.



Also, Please beware when making these sounds yourself to please trim off silence off the end or beginning to a millisecond degree. It helps save space in the long run :P
