# Objective #

To create the most addictive and engaging free FPS in the world.

# About DretchStorm #

DretchStorm is made of a loose-knit group of die-hard Tremulous fans that had the same goal in mind: maintain the [Tremulous](http://tremulous.net) legacy and expand the gameplay with new ideas and a fresh look. We are not associated with the official Tremulous team, nor we follow their plans. We are simply building on the excellent gameplay of Tremulous and molding it in a new direction.

## History ##

The idea started from a [posting](http://tremulous.net/forum/index.php?topic=10001.0) _ghostshell_ made on the Tremulous forums back in 2008 about a mod called UnTrem (Unleashed Tremulous). The idea brewed for a while, growing into something real. Finally in December 2010 it was the right time to invite others to participate and the project got started.

As it turns out, other groups had similar ideas, like the Unvanquished and Xtr3m projects. And suddenly we weren't alone anymore.

## Changes ##

Some of the changes planned for DretchStorm:
  * Game rendering is powered by the awesome [Xreal](http://xreal-project.net) engine. We will try to exploit all its capabilities.
  * Our theme is dark, more violent and gory.
  * Aliens are more arachnid-based, with scorpion and spider attributes.
  * We are leaving all the Quake 3 features behind and embracing Id Tech 4 for a good upgrade path.
  * High-res textures 2048x2048 and higher
  * Newer video hardware features, Opengl 2.0/DirectX 9.0c
  * We work with [OpenGameArt](http://opengameart.org) and [FreeSound](http://freesound.org) to share our assets.
  * Evolved gameplay with character classes, resources, research and experience tracking.
  * Many more, see ProjectGoals

## Help Wanted ##
Being an open source project, we don't have enough resources to do it all. We need some talented people that would like to donate a bit of their time on the following tasks:
  * Character rigging and animation (Blender experience a plus+)
  * Mesh conversions and texture baking.

So if you would like to learn new skills, practice or simply hang out with a cool bunch, drop by #gameboom on irc.freenode.net and let us know.
