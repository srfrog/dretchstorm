DretchStorm is an online-multiplayer FPS with RTS features; like base-building, resources and research. Our goal is to build on the gameplay of Tremulous version 1.1 (w/patches) and extend its features and introduce new tech.

In DretchStorm two teams, the humanoids and the native aliens, constantly fight each other for the control of areas rich in resources needed to survive on harsh environments. Read GameSynopsis for more.

Our releases are organized by goals and each goal is simple-to focus solely on the goal at hand. Our list of GameFeatures serves as a guide to what we want to do. We'll pick the best ideas from online discussions in IRC and our mailinglist. We'll make point releases as we complete goals and the game quality is acceptable. Read ProjectGoals for details.
