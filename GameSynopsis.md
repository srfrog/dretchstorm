This is a writeup to keep our ideas in-check and avoid going in random tangents about features and outcomes. This is very much WIP and it's mostly a placeholder for now.

# Game Synopsis #

### Time setting ###

More than two thousand years from now, circa Earth year 4057 AD

### Background ###

Humans have been exploring space for over 2000 years, and colonizing habitable alien planets during the last 1200 years. Carbon nanotubes, bioconverters and wormhole travel are mature technologies. We know that we are not alone in the universe, that other creatures exist-and most of them hate us. Elerium-115 has replaced Plutonium-250 as an indispensable energy source. And although humans now posses infinite technology they are still bound by the same primitive impulses of lust, envy and greed.

Megalithic corporations, not governments, rule above all humans. They are driven by the desire to grow and expand and with that increase their profits at the cost of freedom. Colonies are founded in newly discovered habitable planets for the purpose of exploiting natural resources, especially Elerium.

Many colonies exist in planets throughout the known universe. so many that security is insufficient to protect them from vast invaders and attackers. the military is only sent as a reactive force with very little preemption. and they leave early to minimize costs and casualties. Many of these planets are inhabited by native aliens that increase the threat to colony survival.

To compensate for the lack of defense, colonies have resorted to hiring mercenaries to protect their cities. mercs consist of ex-military veterans, ex-convicts looking for action and rogue scavengers. these guys have only one goal in mind, to engage in heavy gunfight and exploit the situation for their benefit.

# Intro Story #

## Colony outpost in Xenoz-VI ##

(Xenoz-VI is a colony in the Phi Tauri sector. not a lot of planets are habitable in this sector and colony outposts are far apart from each other--making them very isolated.)

**Colonist:** sir, we have lost contact with the nearest outpost...

**Elder leader:** the outpost is too far from us, we might be on our own.

**Colonist:** should we send an emergency hail to the "security team"?

**Elder leader:** those mercs would love to see us die, just so that they could take all our Elerium and sell it to the highest bidder. the company would pay top credit for it.

**Colonist:** yes sir but our militia is seriously undermanned and underpowered, we are done if the aliens attack us again--we need any help that we can get.

**Elder leader:** send the message, and offer the mercs 2000 units... that's all we got.

**Colonist:** right away sir!

**Elder leader** (to himself): why haven't the aliens come back to finish us... hmmm, it's very strange. it almost seems as if they want us alive for a reason...

## In space freighter Novusordo ##

(travelling about 2.1 parsecs from Xenoz VI)

The crew of the Novusordo:

| **Keiko** | communications specialist, mostly self-taught. she learned some medic skills from her dad while he was stationed in Niveus as a medic during the first Tremorian conquest attempt |
|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shapiro** | the smartest guy in the group--master in photonics and nanites. he can build anything with his nanokit and some Elerium. except he just cant stop himself from stealing |
| **Grimlock** | 1.8m/122kg of lean-mean pure prime animal jarhead. retired and decorated company marine. expert in demolitions, weapons and the ladies. a sailor with a potty mouth but with lots of guts |
| **Shina** & **Rokko** | brother and sister orphans rescued by Cpt.Treb when they were young. Now they are part of the Novusordo and loyal to the captain. they love their nade-n-buzzsaw rampage |
| **Capt. Treb** | nobody really knows. rumors say he's an ex-con and that his whole family was killed by Tyrants, and that somehow he was spared. Now he wanders the black sea looking for new aliens to slaughter. He's has excellent aim and never leaves his trusted mass-driver |

**Keiko:** Captain, we are receiving an urgent hail from Xenoz VI...

**Grimlock:** I was waitin' for those sonnofbitchez to call us.

**Cpt.Treb:** me too Grim. Keiko, play the subspace audio...

...incoming transmission...

**Colonist:** (with a nervous tone) ...Captain Treb...we are calling from Xenoz VI...we are under heavy attack and we require urgent assistance...

**Cpt.Treb:** (to Colonist) citizen have you spotted any Tyrants or Tantalouse ?

**Colonist:** (interference, loud blast sounds in background) ...That is affirmative...we have reports of a Tantalouse queen and thousands of Tyrants heading our way...and we believe the Hypermind is somewhere on the northeast...

**Colonist:** ...I have been authorized to disburse 2000 units of Elerium as payment for your immediate assistance...and our eternal gratitude...

**Shapiro:** (to Cpt.Treb) sir, we are running low on units, maybe we should take this job or we could get stranded on this sector.

**Shina:** NOOOoooo! there's nothin' here it's boooooring! let's go back to Centauri Nexa !!

**Rokko:** Shut up Shina, all that you think about is your stupid chim-chim stores.

**Cpt.Treb:** (to the twins) be quiet both of you! like Shapiro said, we need this.

**Cpt.Treb:** (to Colonist) citizen, we accept your offer. we are on our way--hang in there.

**Colonist:** (explosions in background) ...that's a ROGER...thank you so much...we appreciate it, but PLEASE HURRY...Xenoz-six out!

**Cpt.Treb:** Keiko, set a course for Xenoz VI--we got a new gig. And this one will be a messy dretchstorm.

**Keiko:** Roger captain. The closest path is through the Orion pass...coordinates now locked...

**Grimlock:** time to kick some mothafockin' Tyrant arse!! am gonna give that Tanta-bitch a rocket suppository @!

**Shina + Rokko:** Yeeeeeeeeeeehuuuuuuuuuuu Alright!

**Shapiro:** Captain, there's an old abandoned military facility on Xenoz-VI called "ATCS" that we could salvage. I'm sure we could find plenty of parts and weapon data there.

**Cpt.Treb:** yeah, use any edge possible--I dont want to let any alien alive.

**Keiko:** Captain, I think we could improve the efficiency of our weapons if we study some alien corpses.

**Cpt.Treb:** (walks away and looks outside through a side panel window, leaving the crew discussing among themselves)

**Cpt.Treb:** (thinking) "Where are you bastards coming from? Why do you need us? And why did you spared me? I need to know..."
